For this reason, the bearings have flanges located on both ends so they can be secured on both sides after installation. The clip bearings are slit at an angle, so installation of the bearings is possible from one side. After installation, the bearing opens and forms a lining for the bore hole in the metal plate. The shaft prevents the clip bearing from detaching from the housing. Even during axial movement, the bearing remains secured in the housing. In addition, the lateral slit can compensate for bearing expansions due to temperature or moisture. During expansion, the slit width decreases, and changes so the bearing clearance is minimized. The flange diameter on the smaller side is made to ensure that housings with larger tolerances can be properly secured.",igus,MCI-06-01,4017,0,4017,5,100

It has the clamp style benefits of not marring the shaft, easy removability, and indefinite adjustability while commonly being used for guiding, spacing, stopping, mounting, and component alignment. Equipment manufacturers benefit from the tightly controlled face to bore perpendicularity (TIR of ≤ .002"").

Proprietary processes have been developed by Ruland to maintain superior fit, finish, and holding power. ENSP25-8-A is stamped with the Ruland name for ease of identification. Two-piece styles are mated throughout the manufacturing process for proper fit and alignment. Forged screws test beyond DIN 912 12.9 standards to ensure maximum holding power. ENSP25-8-A is manufactured from solid bar stock sourced from select North American mills and machined to a fine burr free finish.
