For this reason, the bearings have flanges located on both ends so they can be secured on both sides after installation. The clip bearings are slit at an angle, so installation of the bearings is possible from one side. After installation, the bearing opens and forms a lining for the bore hole in the metal plate. The shaft prevents the clip bearing from detaching from the housing. Even during axial movement, the bearing remains secured in the housing. In addition, the lateral slit can compensate for bearing expansions due to temperature or moisture. During expansion, the slit width decreases, and changes so the bearing clearance is minimized. The flange diameter on the smaller side is made to ensure that housings with larger tolerances can be properly secured.",igus,MCI-06-01,4047,0,4047,5,100
